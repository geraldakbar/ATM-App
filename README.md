# ATM-App
Created Using python and Tkinter GUI, in late 2020
Description:
- able to do transfers, or withdraw 
- transfers have a choice ( same or different banks)
- have to enter valid PIN and username ( because i have no idea how to scan cards)

How to use:
- use the following data to login
- 1. username : 'a', PIN: '0000'
- 2. username : 'b', PIN: '1111'
- 3. susername: 'c', PIN: '2222'

Weakness/errors:
- Transfer or withdrawal only affects the users account
- After a few transaction in a row, the program shows errors. (might be a conditionnal error)
- When transfering money, the ATM does not check the validity of the account number
